<!--<title>Snake Game</title>

    Create a username and password 
Background color (canvas) make it into a display block


get image for snake food (mouse?)

get image for snake --Background (grass or out doors layout)

possibly add audio when snake eats and gets larger
    - add short audio when snake goes left and right
    - add longer audio when snake dies

SCORE: 
    - Top left of screen keeps score
    - When you reach a score of 5 (maybe snake changes color?)
    - To win your snake has to go through each color of the rainbow (R,O,Y,G,B,P)
    - You win at 30 points
    - If snake hits a border you revert to being a gray snake & lose all points


JS CODE

define player 
define player position with x y

how fast should the snake move?
- define fallspeed
- movement speed

Will the snake jump obstacles?
- define jumping as true or false
- define jumping speed if true

MAKE SCORE BORD
- name your score bord. maybe something like, myScore , scoreLabel, drawScore..
- should the player start at 0? let score=0;
define your score board. let myScore;


Think of how to CODE a function to BEGIN THE GAME

function startGame () or 
snakegame.start();

SETTING FOOD

-Need a function to set the food out for the snake 


*NEED A LOOP
- draw elements on a screen 
- get user input
- determine collision (eat, hit wall etc)
- determine new positions


SNAKE COLOR
- at 0 points snake is black
- at 2 points snake is red
- at 4 points snake is orange
- at 6 points snake is yellow
- at 8 points snake is green
- at 10 points snake is blue
- at 12 points snake is purple
You win the game at 14 points and the snake changes in sections / intervals rainbow

If snake hits border then snake turns black

OR

change background color of canvas when a milestone is hit

NEED ANIMATION of snake

FUNCTION for locating mice

create images on canva


------------------------------------------------

TO DO

make a fuction to load images 
- think of how to incorporate the different images of the mice

create a function  where snake is an object so we can give it a set amount of joints to start with
- do it under createSnake function maybe?
- how many joints do we start with ? 1 or none?

COLLISSION 
- when the snake collides with the mouse we add a joint to its body
- need a function to call our locateMouse to generate a new mouse in a different section
- Richard suggested function move ()

<!-- ISSUE -->
<!-- Every time I go to the update state, I re-render my component, and therefore shoot off another setTimeout. That's why it's going so fast.  

POSSIBLE RESOLUTION
setTimeout using useEffect and componentDidMount maybe include useRef
